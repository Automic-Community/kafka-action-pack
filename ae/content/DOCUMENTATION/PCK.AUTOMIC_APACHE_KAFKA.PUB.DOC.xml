================================
Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system and a robust queue that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.
Kafka is suitable for both offline and online message consumption. Kafka messages are persisted on the disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss.
It is built on top of the Zoo-Keeper synchronization service. It integrates very well with Apache Storm and Spark for real-time streaming data analysis.

So, it is used for stream processing, website activity tracking, metrics collection and monitoring, log aggregation, real-time analytics, CEP, ingesting data into Spark,
ingesting data into Hadoop,CQRS, replay messages, error recovery, and guaranteed distributed commit log for in-memory computing (microservices).
